### Notes
- The initial code was sourced from [The Startup Buddy Sign-up Page](https://thestartupbuddy.co/home/signup).
- I enhanced the base code to make it fully responsive.
- The project is now deployed on Netlify. You can access it via this link: [https://signup-test-toni.netlify.com](https://signup-test-toni.netlify.com).

### Known Limitations
- The layout for portrait and landscape orientations remains identical.
- I was unable to differentiate layouts for portrait and landscape views because Bootstrap 3.3.7 (used in the base code) does not support landscape-specific layouts.
